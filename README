Connectiproxy demonstrates how to use a Ruby on Rails application with Facebooker as a proxy for Facebook Connect calls from an iPhone.

You must create a config/facebooker.yml file.

In your iPhone set the public key to your public key and the proxy url to http://localhost:3000/facebook/proxy. No private key is needed in the iPhone app.
