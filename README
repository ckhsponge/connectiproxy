Connectiproxy demonstrates how to use a Ruby on Rails application with Facebooker as a proxy for Facebook Connect calls from an iPhone.

You must create a config/facebooker.yml file.

In your iPhone app set the public key to your public key and the proxy url to http://localhost:3000/facebook/proxy. No private key is needed in the iPhone app.

Connectiproxy has been tested successfully using http://github.com/ckhsponge/facebook-iphone-sdk in the iPhone simulator. 
That repository allows extra meta data to be passed from the Rails application to the iPhone application during the proxy connect.
For example, if you need authentication info for iPhone to Rails communication a token can be passed as meta data.

This code is based on code that is live on Toonsy Net.
