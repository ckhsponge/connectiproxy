Connectiproxy demonstrates how to use a Ruby on Rails application with Facebooker as a proxy for Facebook Connect calls from an iPhone.

You must create a config/facebooker.yml file.

In your iPhone app set the public key to your public key and the proxy url to http://localhost:3000/facebook/proxy. No private key is needed in the iPhone app.

Connectiproxy has been tested successfully using http://github.com/ckhsponge/facebook-iphone-sdk in the iPhone simulator. This code is based on code that is live on Toonsy Net.
